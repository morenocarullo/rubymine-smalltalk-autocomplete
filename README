A proof-of-concept of more helpful autocomplete for RubyMine.

To test:

1) copy this folder to the root of your Ruby project

2) add rubymine/scripts to Settings -> Extensions in RubyMine

Now autocompletion will be done on each method of each class, however
methods are only detectd at startup.

If anyone knowing the RM extension API may help getting this realtime...
